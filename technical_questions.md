    ```Automation is play a more imoprt role in the software development. Everybody are talking about CI/CD and number of test. I think automation are moving to focus from number to data analysis. When you have large number of tests how to genernate a smart report is become a challenge. Come up with a smart report maybe use AI could be a new direction.```
